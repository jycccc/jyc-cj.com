  <h3 class="w3-center">DUMPSITE</h3>
  <p class="w3-center"><em>PAYATAS DUMPSITE</em></p>
  <p>The Payatas dumpsite, established in the 1970s, used to be an open dumpsite in Lupang Pangako in Payatas, Quezon City. Prior to this, the area used to be a ravine that was surrounded by farming villages and rice paddies. <br> <br>

People residing in the Smokey Mountain landfill in Tondo, Manila who often works as scavengers migrated to the Payatas dumpsite after the closure of the former in 1995 with the latter developing a reputation as the "Second Smokey Mountain", "21st Century Smokey Mountain", "Smokey Mountain Two", "New Smokey Mountain", "Smokey Valley" or the "Modern-day Smokey Mountain". <br> <br>

In July 10, 2000, a landslide in the area caused the deaths of 232 people residing within the landfill, which prompted the passage of Republic Act No. 9003 or the Ecological Solid Waste Management Act of 2000, which mandates the closure of open dumpsites by 2004 and controlled dumpsites by 2006. The dumping ground was immediately closed following the incident by then-President Joseph Estrada but was reopened weeks later by then-Quezon City Mayor Ismael Mathay Jr. to avert an epidemic in the city due to uncollected garbage caused by the closure. <br> <br>

In 2004, the landfill was reorganized as a controlled disposal facility but was closed in December 2010. A separate landfill with stricter waste management policy was established nearby the old open dumpsite in January 2011. Garbage in the dumpsite was dumped on a layer of tarpaulin to prevent seepage of leachate to the groundwater. The dumpsite closed in December 2017 following the Environmental Management Bureau order issued on August 2, 2017 so that it could review the environmental clearance certificate (ECC) of IPM Environmental Services, the operator of the dumpsite at that time. </p>

  <h3 class="w3-center">CONTROLLING POLLUTION</h3>
  <p class="w3-center"><em>Pollution control is the process of reducing or eliminating the release of pollutants into the environment . It is regulated by various environmental agencies which establish pollutant discharge limits for air, water, and land. <br> <br> 
      
      There are four components of our waste water stream that must be reduced by our pollution control plant. Solid material suspended in the water would make the river cloudy, block sunlight, contain biodegradable materials, and eventually settle to the bottom as muck. The biodegradable materials would extract oxygen from the river and reduce what is available for fish and other forms of life. Nitrogen and phosphorous are nutrients in the wastewater that stimulate growth of plants and algae. When the plants die they extract oxygen from the water as they decay. So much nutrient flows into western Long Island Sound that there is insufficient oxygen for lobsters and other marine life near the sea bottom. Finally, there are bacteria in waste water, some capable of causing disease.   <br> <br>

Our plant removes 97% of the solids that come in the waste water, 98% of the biodegradable materials and 87% of nitrogen nutrients, and then disinfects the water before releasing it into the river. In the future, we will upgrade the plant again to reduce phosphorous nutrients. Some day we may need to address the currently small but growing concern of pharmaceutical residues in our sewage system. <br> <br>
      
      The three R’s – reduce, reuse and recycle – all help to cut down on the amount of waste we throw away. They conserve natural resources, landfill space and energy. Plus, the three R’s save land and money communities must use to dispose of waste in landfills. Siting a new landfill has become difficult and more expensive due to environmental regulations and public opposition. <br> <br>
      
    Air pollution control strategies can be divided into two categories, the control of particulate emissions and the control of gaseous emissions. There are many kinds of equipment which can be used to reduce particulate emissions. Physical separation of the particulates from the air using settling chambers, cyclone collectors, impingers, wet scrubbers , electrostatic precipitators, and filtration devices, are all processes that are typically employed. <br> <br>
